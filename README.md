**Chatbot Project: [Insert Project Name]**
================================================

**Overview**
------------

In this project, I created a chatbot using the popular Python libraries `requests` and `streamlit`. The chatbot is designed to chat with the user and remember the last 5 messages of the user.

**Technical Details**
--------------------

### Dependencies

* `requests` for making API calls
* `streamlit` for building the chatbot interface

### API Key Integration

To integrate the chatbot with the Together API, I obtained an API key from Together and used it to make API calls to retrieve data. The API key is used to authenticate the chatbot's requests and ensure secure data transmission.

### Chatbot Functionality

The chatbot is capable of answering questions, providing information, and has memory (it can remember the last 5 user messages).

### Streamlit Interface

The chatbot is built using Streamlit, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create a user-friendly interface for the chatbot. The interface includes text input field, output display, sidebar to input user API key, and a title for the chatbot.

**Future Development**
--------------------

In the future, I plan to add more features to the chatbot, eg. enhance memory capability even further. 

**Conclusion**
--------------

This project demonstrates my ability to create a chatbot using Python and integrate it with an API. I hope to continue improving and expanding the chatbot's capabilities in the future.

**Chatbot Project: [Insert Project Name]**
================================================

**Overview**
------------

In this project, I created a chatbot using the popular Python libraries `requests` and `streamlit`. The chatbot is designed to [briefly describe the purpose of the chatbot].

**Technical Details**
--------------------

### Dependencies

* `requests` for making API calls
* `streamlit` for building the chatbot interface

### API Key Integration

**Future Development**
--------------------

In the future, I plan to [list any planned updates or enhancements to the chatbot, e.g. adding more features, improving accuracy, etc.].

**Conclusion**
--------------

This project demonstrates my ability to create a chatbot using Python and integrate it with an API. I hope to continue improving and expanding the chatbot's capabilities in the future.
